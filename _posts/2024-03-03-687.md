A quick post on building a Slack bot to help with handoff for ongoing incidents. A good reminder of the powerful combination of APIs for your ops tools and the low barrier to writing and running bots like this with modern cloud infrastructure.

LLRT is an experimental, lightweight JavaScript runtime intended to Serverless environments. It targets a subset of the Node API, but enables much faster startup time and faster overall performance, as well as lower running costs.
