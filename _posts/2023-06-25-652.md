Monitoring. AI developer tools and AI mode vulnerabilities. DNS (always DNS). And an interesting survey focused on SRE to read and participate in.


StackHawk sponsors Devops Weekly
============================

[June 27] Securing GitOps Pipelines: Open Source, Vendors, and Getting Things Done. StackHawk champion James Berthoty is speaking at DevSecCon24 to discuss security in pipeline, open source vs. vendor tools, fixing security findings, and measuring success.

AVID is an AI Vulnerability Database, looking at failures in models. The start of a taxonomy of failure modes, and a database of specific failures. Likely to be an important area of research.

Continuing this long-running series, this post explores naked domains. Some interesting
stats, including that almost three quarters of all domains are IPv4 only.
