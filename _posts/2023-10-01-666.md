Iâ€™m a big Open Policy Agent fan, and a fan of the Rego policy language, but it does require learning a logic programming language that might be unfamiliar to some. Hence this post is likely useful, looking at how to express Or, but covering a bunch of language idioms at the same time.

A good introduction to the role of the API Gateway, and in particularly looking at standardisation in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
