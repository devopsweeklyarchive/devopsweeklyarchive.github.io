Several sets of posts this week on Prometheus and its ecosystem, coming out of the recent PromCon event. Plus discussion of being on-call, a counter-argument for those proposing building a platform and a scattering for other topics, from SBOMs to certificates.

A nice counter argument to building your own platform. Definitely areas to consider before you make an investment, or things to watch out for if you’re building a platform.

Tools
=====

npm now has native support for generating a software bill of materials. I think we’ll see this for other package management tools too.
