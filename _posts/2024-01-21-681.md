Some good tips for being more user centred in IT departments, including multidisciplinary service teams. I do think how IT is treated from the outside has a lot to do with the problem as well though.

A post for other DSL geeks. Mainly discussing Polar, but I think this applies to other policy languages and domains too. Do you want your DSL to be Turing complete?

Vanna allows you to train a model on your database content, and then ask questions of an LLM which will return SQL queries to query it.

Chalk is a new tool that captures metadata at build time, and can add a small 'chalk mark' with that information to any artefacts (like compiled binaries or container images).
