News
====

A good post looking at why measuring team productivity, rather than individual developer productivity, is more useful and can avoid unintended consequences of resulting incentives.

An interesting discussion, asking whether the improved infrastructure management tools have really led to better collaboration. Touches on digital twins and model-driven development approaches.

There are lots of opportunities to use LLMs to improve operations. This video covers several real-world examples and has some good ideas to integrate into your workflows.

Events
======

Networking is still sometimes treated separately when it comes to devops initiatives. Lots of good talks then on changing that at the NetDevOps Days event in New York coming up on October 26th.
