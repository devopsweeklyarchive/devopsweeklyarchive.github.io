News
====

A good introduction to both Terraform and Ansible, covering similarities and differences, as well as how you might use them together.

If you’re doing analysis on a data set, it’s likely important to understand where that data came from, in order for the analysis to be meaningful. This post covers the concept of data lineage, why it’s important, and some tools that can help.

Tools
=====

testkube is a Kubernetes-native testing framework for test execution and orchestration. Store tests from any testing tool as CRDs and run them on the cluster.

The challenge with having discrete applications is that they might not work together, which leaves more work for the user. UFO is a UI-Focused Agent for Windows, which can orchestrate actions across multiple apps without configuration, using GPT-Vision to work out how to achieve the instructions.
