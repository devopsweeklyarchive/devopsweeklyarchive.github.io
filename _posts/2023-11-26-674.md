News
====

There is quite a bit of cross-over between how a central security team needs to interact with a larger development team, and whatâ€™s needed for cost-control in self-service platform teams. A good post on this topic.

How do you switch the build system for more than 200 developers, without slowing developer velocity? A great post on moving to Bazel, including local and remote instrumentation, parallel running and staggered rollout.

Putting aside the marketing spin, this is a good post on running ScyllaDB on Kubernetes using short-lived spot instances.

Focus is a specification aiming to provide an open standard for cloud cost, usage, and billing data across all major cloud service providers. Interesting opportunity for more standardised tooling and transparency.
