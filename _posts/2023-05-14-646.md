Tools
=====

Cedar is a new open source policy language and evaluation engine. Cedar enables developers to express fine-grained permissions as easy-to-understand policies enforced in their applications, and decouple access control from application logic.

Related to the above, an HTTP agent for setting and applying Cedar policies.
