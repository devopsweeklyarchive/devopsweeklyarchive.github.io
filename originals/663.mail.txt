The adoption of new technologies and techniques changes the thread model f=
or an organisation. With AI=2C that change is both broad and happening ver=
y quickly. SAIF is a framework for helping adopt best practices as we know=
 them today to secure AI usage and development.

A detailed case study looking at the adoption of service mesh at scale=2C=
 including on-demand cluster discovery and what it took to migrate a large=
 existing system.

Understanding edge networking is increasingly useful if you find yourself=
 scaling up a system or working on something with lots of users and traffi=
c. A good technical introduction post about packet flow.

Triton is a language and compiler for writing highly efficient custom Deep=
-Learning primitives. The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source envir=
onment to write fast code at higher productivity than CUDA=2C but also wit=
h higher flexibility than other existing DSLs.
